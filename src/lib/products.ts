      "Healthy skin begins with balance. When skin becomes dehydrated or repeatedly stripped of moisture, it often responds by producing excess oil in an effort to protect itself. Over time, this imbalance can leave your complexion feeling dry, congested, oily, or more prone to visible blemishes.\n\nDEW is designed to help restore that balance. Powered by a carefully curated blend of botanical oils that work in harmony with the skin's natural barrier, its lightweight formula absorbs effortlessly to replenish moisture, reinforce barrier function, and leave skin feeling soft, comfortable, and naturally radiant without a heavy or greasy finish.\n\nA resilient skin barrier is the foundation of calm, balanced skin. By helping strengthen and support the skin's natural protective barrier, DEW encourages a complexion that feels less reactive and better able to maintain lasting hydration and comfort over time.\n\nRather than simply providing temporary hydration, DEW works alongside your skin to support long-term balance, resilience, and everyday radiance.\n\nSimple. Effective. Intentionally balanced.",
